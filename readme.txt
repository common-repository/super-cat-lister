Inserts formatted category lists into posts or pages, with numerous options.  Helpful for using Wordpress as a Content Management Systems (CMS).

== Description ==

SuperCatLister greatly extends the abilities of Wordpress as a content management system.  It does this by giving site designers the ability to insert links or content from posts in specified categories into other posts.  

SuperCatLister differs from other category listing solutions because it gives enormous control over the formatting of the included content.  

Its power is further extended by allowing global defaults, which are set in the plugin's administration screen, to be overridden in specific posts by shortcodes.  This allows ease of use combined with enormous flexibility of design. 

Multiple options can be set for each list. Lists can be inserted anywhere in posts and multiple lists can be inserted into posts.
